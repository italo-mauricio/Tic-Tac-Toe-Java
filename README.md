    <h1 align="center">Tic Tac Toe in Java</h1>
    <p>This project is a Tic Tac Toe game in Java, where two players can play. Tic Tac Toe is a popular and simple game that is played on a 3x3 board. The objective is to get three of the same symbols in a row, column, or diagonal.</p>
    <p>This project was developed in Java for educational purposes and to demonstrate the implementation of a simple game in Java. It uses object-oriented programming concepts, such as classes and methods, to implement the game logic.</p>
    <h2>System requirements</h2>
    <p>To run this project, you will need the following software installed on your computer:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>JDK (Java Development Kit) 8 or higher</li>

    </ul>
    <h2>How to run the project</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Clone this repository on your computer using the command below:</li>
    </ol>
    <pre>
      git clone https://github.com/your-username/Tic-Tac-Toe-Java.git
    </pre>
    <ol start="2">
      <li>Open the IDE of your choice and import the project.</li>
      <li>Compile and run the project from the main class.</li>
      <li>When the game starts, both players can take turns playing by entering the row and column in which they want to make their move.</li>
      <li>The game will continue until a player wins or there is a tie.</li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Project structure</h2>
    <p>The project is composed of the following classes:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><code>TicTacToe</code>: the main class that starts the game and manages the players' moves.</li>
      <li><code>Board</code>: the class that represents the game board and its positions.</li>
      <li><code>Player</code>: the class that represents a player and their moves.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>In addition to these classes, the project also includes a <code>Test</code> class that can be used to test the game logic.</p>
